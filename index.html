        <p>I am a postdoctoral researcher in the <a href="https://math.ucsd.edu">mathematics department at UCSD</a>.  I am a recipient of a NSF Mathematical Sciences Research Fellowship, sponsored by <a href="https://mathweb.ucsd.edu/~rsaab/">Rayan Saab</a>.  Prior to this, I was a Ph.D. student in applied mathematics at UCLA, where I was advised by <a href="https://www.math.ucla.edu/~deanna">Deanna Needell</a>.  My pronouns are <i>they/them</i>.
